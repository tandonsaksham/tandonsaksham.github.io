# design-foundations — conventions standard

The rules every pillar skill in this plugin obeys. This is the canonical entry doc; the
authoring template (`references/skill-authoring-template.md`) and the taxonomy (`pillar-taxonomy.md`)
both reference it. Phases 2–6 author one or two pillar skills each — they MUST conform here.

The plugin is `design-foundations` in spirit, `design-for-ai` in name (the name is kept; see
plan). It is a **mixed doctrine + skill plugin**: six design doctrine domains live as reference files in
`references/` (loaded by `Read()` via the §5 resolver in `pillar-taxonomy.md`); four skills in
`skills/` (`clarify`, `prototype`, `usability`, `data-viz`) handle workflow and evaluation
concerns. The plugin manifest has no `skills` array — skills are auto-discovered from `skills/`.

## 1. Frontmatter shape

Every skill `SKILL.md` opens with YAML frontmatter in this shape:

```yaml
---
name: <skill-name>           # ≤64 chars, lowercase a-z 0-9 + single hyphens; MUST equal the directory name; no leading/trailing/consecutive hyphens; never contains "anthropic" or "claude"
description: "<see §2>"        # 1–1024 chars, third person, NO XML tags
user-invocable: true|false    # true for prototype; false for clarify/usability/data-viz
argument-hint: "[context]"    # optional; Claude-Code-only; a short usage hint
---
```

- `name` must match the skill's directory exactly (`skills/usability/` → `name: usability`).
- `user-invocable` and `argument-hint` are Claude-Code-only fields — `validate_skill` reports
  them as non-gating `info`, which is expected and fine (the core skill carries them today).
- No other frontmatter keys unless a later phase documents a reason.

## 2. The ≤1024-char description rule

`description` is **1–1024 characters, hard** (`validate_skill` errors above 1024). This budget
is the entire reason the system exists: the old single skill hit 1023/1024 and could take no
new modes. Per-skill budgets dissolve that ceiling — each pillar gets its own 1024.

Write the description with the skill-craft formula:

> `[Verb-first capabilities]. Use when [triggers/contexts]. Not for: [near-miss exclusions].`

- **Third person, always** — the description is injected into the system prompt.
- **Capability nouns, never process steps** — a step list becomes a shortcut Claude follows
  instead of reading the body.
- **The "Not for:" clause lists near-misses** — the sibling pillars and core modes that share
  keywords but own the concern (see `pillar-taxonomy.md` for each pillar's exact exclusions).
  This is the anti-cannibalization mechanism: disjoint scopes are enforced *in the description*.
- **Measure, don't guess** — `test_triggers` after authoring; `optimize_description` if it
  misfires. Stop at ≤1024 with the near-miss clause present.

## 3. Canonical reference-file shape

Pillar content lives in progressively-loaded reference files under `skills/<pillar>/references/`,
exactly as the core skill's `references/` do. The canonical shape (set during the 2026-06-12
skill-craft refresh — grug `reference-files-canonical-shape`):

- **`## Table of Contents` first** — house rule: any reference file >100 lines opens with a ToC
  (one level deep).
- **Draw from these 11 content sections** as the file needs (not all are mandatory; use what the
  pillar's knowledge calls for): KEY DEFINITIONS, DETECTION CHECKLIST, DESIGN REVIEW CRITERIA,
  RED FLAGS, IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST, DESIGN TRANSFORMATION PATTERNS, CORE PRINCIPLES,
  THIS VS THAT, DESIGN DECISION TABLE, TECHNIQUE REFERENCE, COMMON MISTAKES.
- **Banned constructs — never add these** (they were deliberately stripped and `validate_skill`
  / skill-craft WARN on them): `## RATIONALIZATION COUNTERS` (anti-rationalization tables),
  `## DECISION GATE`, `## PROBLEM -> FIT TABLE`, `## TRIGGERS`, `## PRODUCES`,
  `## NEXT CAPABILITY NEEDED`, `## CSO KEYWORDS`. Routing lives in the SKILL.md, not in the
  reference files.
- **One level deep** — references are loaded by name from SKILL.md; do not nest reference dirs.
- **SKILL.md body < 500 lines** (hard); ~200 lines for the always-relevant core; references hold
  the depth.

## 4. The cite-the-principle house rule

Every recommendation a pillar makes **names its source** — the law, heuristic, book, or chapter
it traces to. No unsourced opinion. Examples in the house voice: "Fitts's law", "Nielsen #4
(consistency)", "data-ink ratio (Tufte)", "Hick's law", "Norman: signifiers > affordances".

**Guardrail (the stay-generative posture — grug `design-pillar-landscape-research` COUNTER):**
principles are cited to **ground** a recommendation, never as a compliance checklist. The
research is explicit that "framework thinking = compliance theater" — laws cited post-hoc to
credential a decision, the framework becoming the deliverable. So:

- Cite to explain *why* a recommendation is right, then recommend. Stay **generative** (select,
  pair, propose) — do not degrade into box-ticking audit.
- UX laws are tendencies under conditions, not physics. A pillar may say "Miller's 7±2 is about
  working memory, not visible menu items" and break the rule when the context warrants. Knowing
  *when a principle does NOT apply* is part of citing it honestly.

## 5. Dependency direction (cite-down, never up)

Cross-pillar citation is **one-way and acyclic** (Clean Architecture dependency rule, applied at
skill scope). `usability` is the innermost design-layer entity: its laws are cited *by* other
pillars, and it cites none of them upward.

- **Allowed:** journey → usability (Hick/Fitts/Miller for option-selection); behavioral →
  usability; deceptive-patterns → usability (and cross-links the core's `ai-tells` ban-list as
  its structural twin); design-systems → the core's palette engine + DESIGN.md.
- **Forbidden:** any cycle. usability must not cite journey/behavioral/etc. The core skill must
  not depend on a pillar. Phase 6 verifies the citation graph is a DAG with usability as a sink.
- **DRY is scoped per-pillar, not across pillars.** Duplicating a usability law verbatim inside
  journey is *safer* than coupling the two skills. Across pillar boundaries, prefer duplication
  over a shared dependency — cross-pillar coupling is the exact failure this system avoids.

## 6. The per-skill eval gate

Every pillar skill passes this gate in its authoring phase before it is considered done:

1. **`validate_skill` = 0 errors / 0 warnings.** Run on `skills/<pillar>`. Non-gating `info`
   notes for Claude-Code-only frontmatter keys (`user-invocable`, `argument-hint`) are expected
   and acceptable. Zero errors and zero warnings is the bar.
2. **`test_triggers` — both directions.** The skill fires on its on-topic queries (positive) AND
   stays quiet on near-miss queries that belong to a sibling or a core mode (negative /
   no-cannibalization). Use the "Not for:" exclusions from `pillar-taxonomy.md` as the near-miss
   set. If it misfires, run `optimize_description` (train/holdout, one iteration per call) until
   both directions pass.
3. **`run_eval` — when to run it.** Run `run_eval` (with-skill vs without-skill, graded
   assertions) on the **keystone `usability` skill** (Phase 2 authors it; the eval is exercised
   at Phase 6) to prove the skill changes behavior, not just triggers. Other pillars gate on
   `validate_skill` + `test_triggers`; reserve `run_eval` for the keystone and for any pillar
   whose value is contested, budget permitting. (If `run_eval` credit is exhausted, drop to
   `test_triggers`-only and note the coverage gap — per plan fallback.)
4. **Description budget re-checked** (§2): ≤1024 chars, near-miss "Not for:" clause present.

Baseline-first discipline (skill-craft): author the skill *after* writing the evals, so the
documented baseline failures are the spec. The harness is the test suite for this markdown
plugin — never hand-fill a compliance verdict; the skill-eval MCP tools compute them.

## 7. Tells & red-flag table re-audit convention

Any tells list or red-flag table in this plugin's doctrine — `references/visual/ai-tells.md`'s
checklists and tables, `deceptive-patterns`' ban-list, or any future pillar's severity table —
decays. The Space Grotesk case is the load-bearing example: Anthropic's Oct 2025 cookbook
recommended it, the same document flagged it as a convergence risk, and by May 2026 the ecosystem
banned it outright (~7 months, theadpharm.com) — "the 'I tried' upgrade." An escape-hatch aesthetic
invented to dodge one round of tells (cream+serif+terracotta; dark+acid-green) becomes the next
round's tell once enough builders reach for it. Rules "calibrate; they don't create taste," and
"without [a] reflective loop, taste hardens into inertia" (designative.info, 2026) — the frozen
list, not the practice of listing, is the failure mode.

Convention:

- **Every tells or red-flag table carries `Last reviewed: YYYY-MM`** immediately above or below its
  heading.
- **Re-audit trigger:** re-check a table's content whenever (a) six months have passed since its
  last review, or (b) a cited example is directly contradicted by a newer, dated source (as Space
  Grotesk was) — whichever comes first.
- **An undated table is presumptively stale.** A REVIEW agent or spot-check treats a missing
  `Last reviewed:` line as a finding, the same way a de-prescription sweep treats an undated
  ban-list-style enumeration as a finding elsewhere in this plugin.
- **Re-auditing means dating, not deleting.** Confirm the entries still hold, correct or remove
  what's decayed (Space Grotesk moves from "recommended" to "banned," it doesn't just vanish), and
  bump the date. The convention outlives any single list.
