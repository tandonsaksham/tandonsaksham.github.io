# AI Design Tells
**Source:** Modern frontend design analysis, grounded in Design for Hackers principles
**Core Concept:** AI-generated interfaces converge on the same visual patterns. They scream "no designer was involved." Replace these defaults with intentional, purpose-driven choices, and the design starts to feel authored instead of generated.

## KEY DEFINITIONS

> **AI slop**: Interface design that's technically competent but visually generic. You can spot it because it follows the same default patterns every AI produces.

> **Design tell**: A visual pattern that reveals how a design was made. Like a poker tell, it signals the absence of a deliberate decision.

> **Convergent design**: The phenomenon where independent AI systems produce nearly identical visual output because they optimize for the same "safe" defaults.

> **Intentional design**: Design where every visual choice traces back to a purpose, audience, or medium decision. The opposite of accepting defaults.

> **Aesthetic direction**: A specific, describable visual personality for a design. Not "clean and modern" (that's the absence of direction) but something like "editorial," "brutalist," or "warm industrial."

> **Visual fingerprint**: The set of distinctive choices that make a design recognizably authored. The details a generic system would never produce.

> **Generic aesthetic**: The visual language that emerges when no design decisions are made. Technically acceptable, aesthetically empty.

> **Authored design**: A design that makes choices a generic system wouldn't make. Choices traceable to a human perspective, a specific audience, or a deliberate creative stance.

## DETECTION CHECKLIST

Signs this knowledge applies:

### Typography Tells
- [ ] Uses Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, or system-ui as primary font, the "safe" defaults every AI reaches for
- [ ] Monospace font used as lazy shorthand for "technical/developer" aesthetic
- [ ] Large rounded-corner icon above every heading (the "feature card" template)
- [ ] All text centered (avoids the harder decision of asymmetric layout)

### Color Tells
- [ ] Cyan/teal on dark background (the "AI dashboard" palette)
- [ ] Purple-to-blue gradients (the "AI product" gradient)
- [ ] Neon accents on dark backgrounds (looks "cool" without design decisions)
- [ ] Gray text on colored backgrounds (washed out, not tinted to match)
- [ ] Pure black (#000) and pure white (#fff) used throughout
- [ ] Gradient text on headings or metrics (decorative, not meaningful)

### Layout Tells
- [ ] Everything wrapped in cards with identical padding and rounded corners
- [ ] Cards nested inside cards (visual noise)
- [ ] Identical card grid: icon + heading + short text, repeated 3-6 times
- [ ] Hero section with big number, small label, supporting stats (the "metric dashboard" template)
- [ ] Everything centered, no asymmetry, no left-aligned text blocks
- [ ] Same spacing everywhere, no rhythm, no grouping hierarchy

### Detail Tells
- [ ] Glassmorphism (blur, glass cards, glow borders) used decoratively
- [ ] Rounded rectangle with thick colored border on one side
- [ ] Sparklines as decoration (tiny charts conveying nothing)
- [ ] Drop shadows that are all identical (no depth hierarchy)
- [ ] Dark mode by default with glowing accents (avoids real color decisions)

### Motion Tells
- [ ] Bounce or elastic easing (feels 2015, not 2025)
- [ ] Everything fades in from below with the same timing
- [ ] Hover effects on everything with no hierarchy of importance

### Copy/Content Tells
Source: Impeccable's deterministic text-tell rules (`em-dash-overuse`, `marketing-buzzword`,
`numbered-section-markers`, `aphoristic-cadence`, `theater-slop-phrase` — pbakaus/impeccable,
Apache-2.0, local read 2026-07-01, cited by name only — no code ported; Phase 6 ports a subset
with full attribution) plus superdesign.dev and dev.to/olehvolos (2026-06) for the microcopy
template. Roughly a fifth of Impeccable's 44-rule catalog is copy/content, a category this file
had none of before this pass.
- [ ] Em-dash overuse — 5+ em-dashes (—) or double-hyphens in body copy; occasional literary use is fine, density is the tell
- [ ] Marketing buzzword stacking — stock SaaS phrases ("streamline your workflow," "unleash the power," "best-in-class," "industry-leading," "seamlessly integrate") standing in for a specific claim
- [ ] Aphoristic cadence — manufactured-contrast sentences ("Not a dashboard. A decision engine.") or short-rebuttal pairs ("Fast. No compromises."), 3+ times in the same body of copy
- [ ] Theater-slop phrasing — dismissing something as "___ theater" (compliance theater, security theater) instead of stating plainly what it does or doesn't do
- [ ] Numbered-section markers as decoration — 01 / 02 / 03 used as section labels with no functional ordering purpose, 3+ sequential occurrences
- [ ] Generic microcopy template — hero headline + subheading + CTA button immediately followed by a logo strip or testimonial row, where every line of copy could be swapped into a different product with no edit

### Developer Statements That Trigger This
- "I asked AI to make it look modern and clean"
- "It looks great but also looks like every other site I've seen lately"
- "I can't tell if this is good design or just AI defaults"
- "It looks professional but I wouldn't remember it tomorrow"

---

## DESIGN REVIEW CRITERIA

### Must Pass (Critical)
- [ ] Design has a stated aesthetic direction that can be described in 2-3 words (not "clean and modern," that's the absence of direction) -> Fail if: you can't name the aesthetic direction or it defaults to "clean/modern/minimal"
- [ ] Primary font is NOT Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, or Arial -> Fail if: the default safe font was accepted without a typographic decision (Ch 3)
- [ ] Color palette is NOT cyan-on-dark or purple-to-blue gradient -> Fail if: the color scheme matches the AI default palette with no rationale grounded in mood or audience (Ch 9)
- [ ] Layout includes asymmetry or intentional breaking of the grid -> Fail if: every section is centered, every card is identical, no element breaks the pattern (Ch 6)
- [ ] If shown to someone with "AI made this," they would NOT immediately believe it -> Fail if: the design is indistinguishable from generic AI output

### Should Pass (Important)
- [ ] At least one memorable visual element someone would describe to a friend -> Warning if: nothing in the design is distinctive enough to recall
- [ ] Design choices are traceable to purpose and audience (Ch 1-2) -> Warning if: no rationale exists beyond "it looked good"
- [ ] Typography has personality beyond "legible" (Ch 3) -> Warning if: font choice conveys no mood, context, or medium awareness

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Design includes a detail that reveals craft: a custom illustration, an unusual interaction, a considered micro-animation -> Suggestion: add one element that could only exist in this specific design
- [ ] Color palette uses hue-shifted shadows and highlights rather than pure black/white overlays (Ch 9) -> Suggestion: apply warm/cool shadow technique to add depth

## RED FLAGS

**Last reviewed: 2026-07**

| Flag | Severity | What It Indicates | Theory Violation | Fix |
|------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----|
| Inter/Roboto as primary font | High | No typography decision was made | Ch 3: typeface must match medium AND context AND mood | Choose a font that reflects the design's purpose and personality |
| Cyan-on-dark palette | High | Default AI color scheme, no color theory applied | Ch 9: colors should follow mood, context, and wheel relationships | Build palette from mood -> base hue -> color wheel scheme |
| Everything in cards | High | No composition decisions made | Ch 6: composition needs dominance, contrast, and varied elements | Remove cards where content doesn't need containment; vary presentation |
| All text centered | Medium | Avoided layout decisions | Ch 6: directional flow and reading patterns matter | Left-align body text; use asymmetric layouts |
| Same spacing everywhere | Medium | No hierarchy through white space | Ch 7: white space is the most powerful hierarchy signal | Use proportional spacing — tight within groups, generous between |
| Dark mode + neon accents | Medium | "Cool" aesthetic substituting for design decisions | Ch 1: design is purpose + medium + aesthetics, not surface styling | Choose light or dark based on content needs and audience |
| Gradient text on metrics | Low | Decorative pattern masking lack of data hierarchy | Ch 7: hierarchy through weight > size > color, not decoration | Use solid colors; establish hierarchy through proportion |

### Checkable Signatures (2026)

**Last reviewed: 2026-07**

These sharpen the pattern-level flags above into evidence a detector (or a human) can check directly
— a hex to grep, an opacity range, a binary yes/no — instead of a visual impression. They are dated
examples of the same convergence principle, not a new frozen ban-list: see Decay Doctrine below for
why the escape-hatch rows exist and how they get re-audited.

| Signature | Observable Check | Severity | Source (dated) |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|-----------------|
| Purple-indigo-violet triplet | Hex `#6366F1` (indigo-500), `#8B5CF6` (violet-500), or `#A855F7` (purple-500) — or the matching Tailwind utility classes — used as an accent, gradient, or heading color on white/`#F9FAFB` | High | superdesign.dev, 2026-06-15 (updated 2026-06-26) |
| Uniform 0.1-opacity shadow | `box-shadow`/`drop-shadow` alpha in the 0.08–0.12 range applied identically across 3+ elements with no depth variation | Medium | superdesign.dev, 2026-06 |
| Unmodified Tailwind/shadcn defaults | Binary check: do the shipped `--radius`, spacing scale, and shadow CSS variables differ from shadcn/ui's generated defaults? No diff = tell | High | dev.to/olehvolos, 2026-06-02 (names Lovable, v0, Bolt as the tools shipping this look unmodified) |
| Cream+serif+terracotta cluster | Background near `#F4F1EA` + high-contrast serif display + terracotta accent, co-occurring | Medium — escape-hatch, decaying (register-legitimate in some editorial/luxury contexts; see THIS VS THAT) | Anthropic frontend-design plugin SKILL.md (277k+ installs; fetched 2026), one of three named "default aesthetic clusters" |
| Dark+acid-green (or vermilion) cluster | Near-black background (`#0a0a0a`–`#1a1a1a`) + a single bright acid-green or vermilion accent as the sole differentiator | Medium — escape-hatch, decaying | Anthropic frontend-design plugin SKILL.md, same source |
| Space Grotesk as primary/display font | `font-family` includes "Space Grotesk" | High — reversed from a 2025 recommendation, see Decay Doctrine | Anthropic cookbook, Oct 2025 (recommended) → theadpharm.com, 2026-05 (banned: "the 'I tried' upgrade") |

---

## IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### Before Starting
- [ ] Choose a BOLD aesthetic direction, not "clean and modern" (that's AI default). Pick something specific:
  - Brutally minimal (lots of white space, stark typography, few elements)
  - Editorial/magazine (columns, pull quotes, oversized typography)
  - Organic/natural (textures, warm tones, hand-drawn elements)
  - Industrial/utilitarian (dense information, monospace for DATA not aesthetic, functional color)
  - Retro-futuristic (geometric shapes, unusual color combos, custom illustrations)
  - Luxury/refined (restrained palette, generous margins, serif typography)
  - Playful/toy-like (bright colors, large rounded elements, bouncy but tasteful motion)
- [ ] State the aesthetic direction in 2-3 words and write it down. Every subsequent decision must serve it
- [ ] Identify the audience and purpose (Ch 1-2). The aesthetic direction must connect to both

### During Design
- [ ] Step 1: For every visual choice, ask: "Would a different AI make this same choice?" If yes, reconsider
  - Verify: The choice is specific to this design's aesthetic direction, not a generic default
- [ ] Step 2: Choose typography that has personality and matches the medium (Ch 3)
  - Verify: Font is NOT Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, or Arial; font choice is defensible based on mood and context
- [ ] Step 3: Build color palette from mood -> base hue -> color wheel scheme (Ch 9)
  - Verify: Palette is NOT cyan-on-dark or purple-to-blue; palette follows an identifiable color wheel relationship
- [ ] Step 4: Create layout with intentional asymmetry and varied presentation (Ch 6)
  - Verify: Not everything is in identical cards; not everything is centered; spacing varies to create grouping hierarchy
- [ ] Step 5: Establish visual hierarchy through proportion and white space (Ch 5, 7)
  - Verify: Elements have clear dominance relationships; white space creates rhythm, not uniform padding

### After Design
- [ ] The AI Slop Test: "If I told someone AI made this, would they believe me immediately?" If yes, go back
- [ ] Can you name the aesthetic direction in 2-3 words?
- [ ] Can you point to at least one choice a generic AI wouldn't have made?
- [ ] Does the design serve its purpose and audience, or just "look nice"?

## DESIGN TRANSFORMATION PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Generic Font + Card Grid + Gray Palette -> Distinctive Font + Varied Layout + Intentional Palette

**Problem (Before):**
Inter font, a 3-column card grid (icon + heading + paragraph, repeated 6 times), gray-on-white color scheme. This is the single most common AI output. Every model treats Inter as safe, cards as the universal container, and gray as neutral. The result says nothing about the product, audience, or purpose.

**Solution (After):**
Pick a typeface that matches the design's personality: a geometric sans for precision, a humanist serif for warmth, a slab serif for authority (Ch 3). Replace the card grid with mixed presentation: a hero element, a list, a sidebar callout, a feature highlight with asymmetric layout (Ch 6). Build a palette from mood and audience using color wheel relationships (Ch 9).

**Key Change:** Every default got replaced with a decision. The font says something. The layout has hierarchy. The colors have rationale.

---

### Pattern 2: Cyan-on-Dark Dashboard -> Purpose-Driven Palette Grounded in Audience Needs

**Problem (Before):**
Dark background, cyan/teal accent color, purple secondary, neon glow effects. This is the "AI dashboard" aesthetic. It looks technical and futuristic but communicates nothing about the specific product. Every AI coding tool, analytics platform, and developer product converges on this palette because dark + cyan tests well in isolation.

**Solution (After):**
Start from the audience and purpose (Ch 1-2). A financial dashboard needs calm authority: deep navy with warm amber accents, not neon. A health app needs trust and warmth: soft greens and warm neutrals. Build the palette using color wheel schemes (Ch 9) rooted in the psychological response you need from the specific audience.

**Key Change:** Color choices driven by who uses the product and what they need to feel. Not by what "looks techy."

---

### Pattern 3: Identical Card Grid -> Mixed Presentation with Hierarchy

**Problem (Before):**
Every section uses the same card format: rounded rectangle, icon, heading, 2-line description, repeated in a 3-column grid. Composition without decisions. Every element has equal visual weight. Nothing dominates. Nothing recedes. The eye has nowhere to go (Ch 6, Ch 7).

**Solution (After):**
Create a composition with clear dominance (Ch 6): one hero element that commands attention, supporting elements in varied formats (a list, a comparison table, a pull quote, a full-width callout). Use white space to create grouping hierarchy (Ch 7), tight spacing within related items, generous spacing between groups.

**Key Change:** Uniform repetition replaced with intentional hierarchy. The layout tells the viewer what matters most.

---

### Pattern 4: Centered Everything -> Asymmetric Layout with Directional Flow

**Problem (Before):**
Every heading centered, every paragraph centered, every button centered. Centering is the default because it dodges the harder decision of where to place things asymmetrically. The result has no directional flow. The eye bounces instead of scanning (Ch 6).

**Solution (After):**
Left-align body text for readability. Use asymmetric layouts where a dominant element anchors one side and supporting content fills the other (Ch 6). Create clear directional flow: the viewer's eye should move through the page in a deliberate sequence, guided by proportion and white space (Ch 5, Ch 7).

**Key Change:** The absence of a layout decision got replaced with a specific compositional structure that guides the viewer.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

The problem with AI-generated design isn't that it's bad. It's that it's all the same. When every AI converges on the same "clean, modern" aesthetic, that aesthetic becomes a signal of laziness, not quality. Design should be intentional: every visual choice traceable to purpose (Ch 1), audience (Ch 2), and medium (Ch 3). An authored design makes choices a generic system wouldn't make.

### Decay Doctrine

Tells decay. Anthropic's own Oct 2025 cookbook recommended Space Grotesk for a "Code aesthetic" and
flagged it as a convergence risk in the same document; ecosystem practice caught up within roughly
seven months (theadpharm.com, 2026-05) and now bans it outright — "the 'I tried' upgrade." The same
pattern repeats structurally: an escape-hatch aesthetic invented to dodge one generation of tells
(cream+serif+terracotta; dark+acid-green — see Checkable Signatures above) becomes, once enough
builders reach for it, the next generation's tell. A tells list is a snapshot of the current default,
not a permanent ban.

Two consequences for how this file is used and maintained:

- **Every table in this file carries `Last reviewed: 2026-07`.** Treat any undated tells or red-flag
  table anywhere in this plugin's doctrine as presumptively stale — the re-audit convention (cadence,
  what counts as a trigger, how a stale list gets flagged) lives in `docs/foundations-standards.md`.
- **Guard against over-correction becoming the new tell.** An anti-slop pass that pushes every output
  toward the same "edgy" register — the same escape-hatch cluster, the same forced asymmetry — is
  itself a uniform failure mode; it has moved the convergence point, not removed it. Review verifies
  variance *across* a body of outputs (does project A look different from project B?), not only each
  output's distance from the AI-default baseline in isolation. A design that avoids every hex in the
  Checkable Signatures table but is indistinguishable from the last three projects that also avoided
  them has not passed (developersdigest.tech, 2026).

### CHECKER Mode
When reviewing an existing design, verify:
- [ ] The design has a stated aesthetic direction beyond "clean and modern"
- [ ] Typography choice reflects personality, mood, and medium, not AI defaults (Ch 3)
- [ ] Color palette follows a color wheel relationship grounded in mood and audience, not AI defaults (Ch 9)
- [ ] Layout has intentional hierarchy with dominance, subordination, and varied presentation (Ch 6, Ch 7)
- [ ] At least one element is distinctive enough that a generic AI wouldn't produce it
- [ ] The design wouldn't be immediately believed if someone said "AI made this"

**Severity Classification:**

**Last reviewed: 2026-07**

| Violation Type | Severity | Rationale |
|----------------|----------|-----------|
| No aesthetic direction (defaults to "clean and modern") | Critical | Absence of design decisions; every subsequent choice will be generic |
| AI default font (Inter, Roboto, Open Sans) with no rationale | High | Signals no typographic decision was made (Ch 3) |
| AI default palette (cyan-on-dark, purple-to-blue) with no rationale | High | Signals no color theory was applied (Ch 9) |
| Identical card grid with no compositional hierarchy | High | No dominance, no visual flow, no hierarchy (Ch 6, Ch 7) |
| All text centered with no asymmetry | Medium | Avoidance of layout decisions, not a layout decision (Ch 6) |
| Uniform spacing throughout | Medium | No grouping hierarchy through white space (Ch 7) |
| Decorative elements (glassmorphism, gradient text, sparklines) without purpose | Low | Decoration masking the absence of design decisions (Ch 1) |

### APPLIER Mode
When creating or modifying a design, ensure:
- [ ] State an aesthetic direction in 2-3 specific words before making any visual choices
- [ ] Select typography based on personality, mood, and medium, not safety (Ch 3)
- [ ] Build color palette from mood -> base hue -> color wheel scheme (Ch 9)
- [ ] Compose layout with clear dominance, varied presentation, and intentional asymmetry (Ch 6)
- [ ] Establish hierarchy through proportion and white space, not uniform treatment (Ch 5, Ch 7)
- [ ] Test every choice against "Would a different AI make this same choice?"

## THIS VS THAT

**Last reviewed: 2026-07**

| Confusion Point | This File Says | Not This |
|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| "AI design is always bad" | AI design is technically competent but generic; the issue is convergence, not quality. Every AI produces the same output, so it becomes a recognizable signal | AI-generated designs are inherently low quality or broken |
| "Just pick unusual fonts" | Unusual fonts without purpose are still decoration; choose fonts that match the design's personality and medium (Ch 3) | Differentiation means using obscure or quirky fonts |
| "Dark mode is always an AI tell" | Dark mode is appropriate for some contexts (nightlife, media, low-light use); the tell is dark-mode-by-default with no rationale | You should never use dark backgrounds |
| "Clean and modern is a valid direction" | "Clean and modern" is the absence of direction. It's what you get when no aesthetic decision was made; a real direction is specific enough that someone could disagree with it | Minimal, clean aesthetics are always generic |
| "More distinctive means better" | Distinctiveness without purpose is just novelty; every choice must trace back to audience and intent (Ch 1-2) | The goal is to be as visually unusual as possible |
| "AI tells only matter for designers" | 75% of website credibility judgments are design-based (Ch 1); users don't consciously catalog tells, but they register the generic feeling | Only designers notice these patterns |

## DESIGN DECISION TABLE

**Last reviewed: 2026-07**

| Decision Point | Options | This File Recommends | When |
|----------------|---------|---------------------|------|
| Aesthetic direction | "Clean and modern" vs. specific direction | Always choose a specific direction (editorial, brutalist, warm industrial, etc.) | Before any visual decisions are made; this frames everything else |
| Primary typeface | AI defaults (Inter, Roboto, Open Sans) vs. intentional choice | Intentional choice matched to personality, mood, and medium (Ch 3) | When setting up the design system; the font signals whether a design decision was made |
| Color palette approach | AI defaults (cyan-on-dark, purple-to-blue) vs. mood-driven scheme | Mood-driven palette using color wheel relationships (Ch 9) | When establishing the visual identity; palette should be traceable to audience and purpose |
| Layout structure | Uniform card grid vs. mixed presentation | Mixed presentation with clear hierarchy (Ch 6, Ch 7) | When organizing content; vary the container types and establish dominance |
| Text alignment | Center everything vs. intentional alignment | Left-align body text; use centering only for specific elements with rationale (Ch 6) | When laying out text; centering should be a conscious choice, not a default |
| Dark vs. light mode | Dark by default vs. context-driven choice | Choose based on content, audience, and use context — not because dark "looks cool" (Ch 1) | When setting the overall tone; dark mode is a design decision, not a default |
| Decorative effects | Glassmorphism, gradients, glow vs. purposeful detail | Use effects only when they serve hierarchy or communication, not decoration | When adding visual polish; every effect should have a reason |

## TECHNIQUE REFERENCE

**Last reviewed: 2026-07**

| Technique | What It Does | When to Use | How to Apply |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| AI Slop Test | Reveals whether a design is distinguishable from generic AI output | After completing any AI-assisted design | Ask: "If I told someone AI made this, would they believe me immediately?" If yes, identify which tells are present and address them |
| Aesthetic direction statement | Forces a specific creative stance before visual decisions begin | At the start of any design project | Write down the direction in 2-3 words; reject "clean and modern"; every subsequent choice must serve this direction |
| Default substitution check | Catches AI defaults before they become embedded | During every visual decision | Ask: "Would a different AI make this same choice?" If yes, the choice is a default, not a decision |
| Convergence audit | Identifies which elements match the AI default template | When reviewing a completed AI-assisted design | Run through the Detection Checklist category by category; count how many tells are present |
| Mixed presentation design | Replaces uniform card grids with hierarchical, varied layouts | When laying out content sections | Use at least 3 different presentation formats (hero, list, sidebar, callout, table) instead of repeating one card format |
| Personality font selection | Replaces safe default fonts with typefaces that convey mood and intent | When choosing primary typography | Identify the design's personality, research typefaces designed for that mood and medium, select one that a generic AI wouldn't choose (Ch 3) |

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

**Last reviewed: 2026-07**

| Mistake | Why It Happens | Correct Approach |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| Accepting AI font defaults without evaluation | Inter and Roboto are genuinely good fonts; they feel "safe" | Good font, bad signal. The safety is the problem; choose a font that reflects the specific design's personality (Ch 3) |
| Replacing one AI default with another | Developer swaps cyan-on-dark for purple-on-dark, thinking they've differentiated | The issue isn't the specific default but the lack of a design decision; build palette from mood and audience (Ch 9) |
| Adding decoration to mask generic structure | Glassmorphism, gradient text, and glow effects layered onto a standard card grid | Decoration without structure is still generic; fix the composition and hierarchy first (Ch 6, Ch 7), then add effects with purpose |
| Equating "different" with "good" | Developer picks an unusual font and wild colors to avoid AI tells | Distinctiveness must serve purpose and audience; unusual choices without rationale are just novelty (Ch 1-2) |
| Treating AI tells as a checklist to tick off | Developer changes the font and colors but keeps identical structure and spacing | AI tells are symptoms of absent decisions; address the root cause (no aesthetic direction) not just the surface signals |
| Thinking "clean and modern" is an aesthetic direction | It describes the absence of dirt and the presence of recency, not a visual personality | A real direction is specific enough that someone could disagree with it: "brutalist" has critics, "clean" doesn't |

## FINGERPRINT ADDENDUM — CLAUDE FABLE 5 DEFAULTS

**Added: 2026-07-02 · Last reviewed: 2026-07 · Review by: 2026-10 (tells decay — re-measure)**

The tell catalog above and the Anthropic "AI slop" cookbook were benchmarked on sonnet-4-6. This addendum records the *first measured fingerprint of Claude Fable 5's own defaults* — no prior source has it. It is empirical, not curated: N=6 UI mocks were generated from plain one-line briefs (pricing page, SaaS landing, analytics dashboard, login screen, settings page, blog index) in **fresh, doctrine-free `claude -p` contexts** (no design-for-ai skill, no `ai-tells.md`, run from a directory outside this repo so no project `CLAUDE.md` loaded), then scored with `scripts/detect.mjs`. Artifacts: `skills/design-for-ai-workspace/fingerprint/` (6 `.html`, 6 `detect-*.json`, `summary.json`).

**What Fable 5 actually exhibits, by prevalence (files that fired the rule / 6):**

| Rank | Tell (detect.mjs rule) | Prevalence | Total hits | Severity | Reading |
|------|------------------------|------------|------------|----------|---------|
| 1 | `nested-cards` (card inside a card) | **6 / 6** | 42 | high | The dominant Fable 5 default. Every single unprompted mock nested cards; the settings page alone fired it many times. This is the single highest-yield thing to design against. |
| 2 | `overused-font` (Inter / Roboto / Open Sans etc.) | **4 / 6** | 4 | medium | Still reaches for the safe sans by default in two-thirds of outputs. |
| 3 | `purple-triplet` (`#6366F1`/`#8B5CF6`/`#A855F7` family) | 2 / 6 | 3 | high | Present but NOT universal — the purple gradient is receding as a Fable 5 default vs. the sonnet-4-6 fingerprint, though it still surfaces. |
| 3 | `em-dash-overuse` | 2 / 6 | 2 | medium | The copy tell shows up but at low density. |
| 5 | `hero-eyebrow-chip` (eyebrow label above H1) | 1 / 6 | 1 | high | Occasional, not reflexive. |
| 5 | `numbered-section-markers` | 1 / 6 | 1 | advisory | Rare. |

**Top default tells named:** (1) **nested cards** — by a wide margin the defining structural tell of Fable 5's unprompted UI; (2) **overused safe sans** (Inter/Roboto family); (3) the **purple triplet**, now intermittent rather than reflexive.

**Notes and honest limits.**
- Detector-catchable tells only. `detect.mjs` is a static-analysis subset (16 rules); tells it does not encode (e.g. uniform spacing rhythm, generic imagery) are out of scope and undercounted here.
- Per-file hit counts: settings 25, landing 12, pricing 10, dashboard 3, blog 2, login 1. Denser/component-heavier surfaces (settings, landing) express more tells; sparse surfaces (login) express almost none — genericness is partly a function of surface complexity, not just model default.
- Small N (6), single generation each, one model snapshot. This is a fingerprint, not a distribution. **Tells decay** (per the decay doctrine above): re-measure by 2026-10. The nested-card dominance in particular is the current signature and should be re-checked as Fable 5 updates.
