## 1. Full Design Review Checklist

**Last reviewed: 2026-07.** Screenshot-grounded review of the rendered mock takes priority over
working this list top-to-bottom — use these as the named checks worth confirming when a rendered
surface looks off, not as a pre-ship tick-box gate.

### Typography Checks

**Must Pass (Critical)**
- [ ] Typeface is appropriate for its rendering medium (screen vs print) -- no print-optimized humanist serif (e.g., Garamond) at body sizes on ~100-150 ppi screens *(Ch 3)*
- [ ] Body text typeface produces even texture -- squint test reveals no dark blotches or light gaps *(Ch 3)*
- [ ] Typeface letterfit allows proper kerning -- no awkward gaps or collisions between common letter pairs *(Ch 3)*
- [ ] No fake bold (artificially bolded via software outline) *(Appendix)*
- [ ] No fake italic (artificially slanted via software) *(Appendix)*
- [ ] No type distortion (stretching/compressing) *(Appendix)*
- [ ] Font pairing uses compatible letter structures (both humanist, both geometric, both realist) or deliberate extreme contrast *(Appendix)*
- [ ] Maximum two font families for text content (one serif, one sans-serif; logos and code fonts excluded) *(Appendix)*
- [ ] Serif + sans-serif pairing rule followed (not two serifs or two sans-serifs without clear justification) *(Appendix)*

**Should Pass (Important)**
- [ ] Typeface has sufficient x-height for screen readability *(Ch 3)*

- [ ] Smart/curly quotes used instead of straight quotes *(Appendix)*
- [ ] Proper dashes used (en dash or em dash, not double hyphens) *(Appendix)*
- [ ] One space after periods, not two *(Appendix)*
- [ ] Body text uses ragged right alignment on web (no `text-align: justify` without hyphenation) *(Appendix)*
- [ ] Leading/line-height between 1.2em and 1.4em for body copy *(Appendix)*
- [ ] Paragraph changes indicated by EITHER indentation OR spacing, not both *(Appendix)*

**Nice to Have**

- [ ] Authentic small caps used for acronyms *(Appendix)*
- [ ] Prime marks used for feet/inches instead of smart quotes *(Appendix)*

### Color Checks

**Must Pass (Critical)**

## 3. Design Decision Trees

### "I Need to Choose Colors"

```
START: What is the design's purpose and mood?
|
+---> Identify mood
|     |
|     +---> Mysterious/Exclusive --> Dark background + sparse bright accents
|     +---> Active/Energetic ------> Bright saturated + complementary/triadic scheme
|     +---> Muted/Sophisticated ---> Low saturation + neutral dominant + one strong accent
|     +---> Natural/Earthy --------> Warm unsaturated + greens/browns
|     +---> Calm/Professional -----> Cool colors (blue/green), analogous scheme
|
+---> Choose background color based on content density
|     |
|     +---> Content-heavy page --> White or off-white
|     +---> Exclusive/nightlife --> Dark
|     +---> Low-content splash --> Bright saturated OK
|
+---> Select base hue aligned with mood
|     |
|     +---> Does it match psychological associations? (Ch 9)
|     +---> Does it match cultural context of audience? (Ch 9)
|     +---> Is red being used in an analytical/performance context? --> STOP, use blue/green
|
+---> Build color scheme from color wheel
|     |
|     +---> Want quiet/focused? ---------> Monochromatic (one hue, varied tints/shades)
|     +---> Want harmonious/peaceful? ---> Analogous (3 adjacent hues)
|     +---> Want exciting/energetic? ----> Complementary (opposite hues)
|     +---> Want colorful but balanced? -> Split-complementary
|     +---> Want cheery/approachable? ---> Triadic (3 evenly spaced)
|     +---> Need complex palette? -------> Tetradic (use with care)
|
+---> Assign functional roles
|     |
|     +---> Links: Blue (or form of blue) for wide-audience sites
|     +---> Errors/urgency: Red
|     +---> Success/progress: Green
|     +---> Highlights/attention: Yellow
|     +---> CTA: Whichever contrasts MOST with dominant scheme
|
+---> Create depth with warm/cool
|     |
|     +---> Primary text: Warm dark color (e.g., #503e2b)
|     +---> Secondary text: Cool gray (e.g., #808094)
|     +---> Shadows: Shift cooler than base
|     +---> Highlights: Shift warmer than base
|
+---> Validate
      |
      +---> Colorblindness test: Add redundant cues (shape, text) to all color-coded info
      +---> Data viz: Use Lab/Colorbrewer for perceptually uniform palettes
      +---> Web images: Save in sRGB, strip ICC profiles for CSS-matching images
      +---> Cross-media: Use ICC profiles for print conversion
```

### "I Need to Pick Fonts"

```
START: What is the medium?
|
+---> Web (screen) -----> Default to sans-serif for body text
|     |                   Consider: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, Gill Sans, Lucida Grande
|     |
|     +---> Need a serif? --> Use Georgia (screen-optimized) not Garamond
|     +---> Custom fonts? --> OK above 30px; stick with web-safe below 30px on ~100-150 ppi
|
+---> Print ------------> Default to serif for body text
      |                   Consider: Adobe Garamond, Palatino, Baskerville, Bodoni
      |
      +---> Need sans-serif? --> Gill Sans, Futura, Helvetica work well for headers
|
+---> Do you need a second font?
|     |
|     +---> No --> Use one font with weight/size variations (often sufficient)
|     +---> Yes --> Continue to pairing
|
+---> Pairing strategy
|     |
|     +---> Step 1: Identify letter structure of primary font
|     |     +---> Compare lowercase 'n'
|     |     +---> Humanist: organic shoulder curve (Garamond, Gill Sans, Palatino)
|     |     +---> Geometric: symmetrical arch (Futura, Bodoni)
|     |     +---> Realist: in between (Helvetica, Arial, Baskerville)
|     |
|     +---> Step 2: Choose pairing approach
|     |     +---> Harmony --> Match letter structures (both humanist, both geometric, etc.)
|     |     +---> Contrast --> Use dramatically different fonts (deliberate extreme)
|     |     +---> AVOID --> "Sort of similar" middle ground (uncanny valley)
|     |
|     +---> Step 3: Verify compatibility
|     |     +---> Compare 'n' width (character width match?)
|     |     +---> Squint test (texture darkness match?)
|     |     +---> Smoothness check (both smooth or both rough?)
|     |
|     +---> Step 4: Ensure one serif + one sans-serif (the rule)
|     |
|     +---> Shortcut: Choose fonts by same type designer (e.g., Gill Sans + Joanna)
|
+---> Set body copy
      |
      +---> Line-height: 1.2-1.4em for body, 1.0-1.1em for lists
      +---> Alignment: Ragged right for web (no justify without hyphenation)
      +---> Paragraphs: Indent (~1em) OR spacing (~0.8em), never both
      +---> Characters: Smart quotes, proper dashes, no double spaces
      +---> Bold/italic: Use authentic font weights only (no fakes)
```

### "My Layout Feels Off" -- Diagnostic Flow

```
START: What specifically feels wrong?
|
+---> "Nothing draws my eye"
|     |
|     +---> Is there a dominant element? (Ch 6)
|     |     +---> No --> Make one element dominant via size, color, value, or white space
|     |     +---> Yes but weak --> Increase contrast between dominant and subordinate elements
|     |
|     +---> Is there foreground/background depth? (Ch 6)
|           +---> No --> Add size, detail, shadow, or color intensity differences
|
+---> "Everything looks the same importance"
|     |
|     +---> Are you using only font size to differentiate? (Ch 7)
|     |     +---> Yes --> Start with white space alone, then layer: weight > size > color > ornamentation
|     |
|     +---> Are size differences big enough? (Ch 7)
|     |     +---> Less than 25% --> Skip steps in your type scale (e.g., 9pt to 16pt, not 9pt to 12pt)
|     |
|     +---> Is white space between all elements identical? (Ch 7)
|           +---> Yes --> Use proportional spacing: less between related, more between unrelated
|
+---> "It feels random/incoherent"
|     |
|     +---> Do element sizes relate through a ratio? (Ch 5)
|     |     +---> No --> Choose a base ratio (2:3 or 3:4) and derive dimensions from it
|     |
|     +---> Is there a consistent shape language? (Ch 6)
|     |     +---> No --> Establish shapes (all rounded or all angular) and repeat throughout
|     |
|     +---> Do colors follow a color wheel relationship? (Ch 9)
|           +---> No --> Pick a scheme type and rebuild palette from the color wheel
|
+---> "It feels cluttered"
|     |
|     +---> Are there unnecessary rule lines or borders? (Ch 7)
|     |     +---> Yes --> Remove them; use white space and alignment instead (Tufte 1+1=3)
|     |
|     +---> Is there too much ornamentation? (Ch 7)
|     |     +---> Yes --> Strip all ornamentation; rebuild hierarchy with space > weight > size
|     |
|     +---> Are margins/padding arbitrary? (Ch 5)
|           +---> Yes --> Use proportional margins (Tschichold method or consistent ratio)
|
+---> "It feels flat/lifeless"
|     |
|     +---> Are all colors neutral black/gray? (Ch 9)
|     |     +---> Yes --> Replace with warm dark for primary, cool gray for secondary text
|     |
|     +---> Are shadows pure black? (Ch 9)
|     |     +---> Yes --> Use hue-shifted shadows (cooler) and highlights (warmer)
|     |
|     +---> Is there no rhythm or repeating pattern? (Ch 6)
|     |     +---> Yes --> Add consistent spacing, repeating icon styles, regular visual beats
|     |
|     +---> Is there no texture variation? (Ch 6)
|           +---> Yes --> Introduce subtle texture differences between foreground and background
|
+---> "The eye wanders off the page"
      |
      +---> Are there directional forces guiding the eye? (Ch 6)
      |     +---> No --> Use alignment, progressive sizing, shape groupings to create flow
      |
      +---> Is the eye being "recycled" at exit points? (Ch 6)
      |     +---> No --> Add directional cues redirecting the eye back into the composition
      |
      +---> Is critical content in the top-left (F-pattern)? (Ch 6)
            +---> No --> Reposition or create strong directional forces leading to it
```

### "I Need to Establish Hierarchy"

```
START: List all information pieces and their relative importance/relationships
|
+---> Step 1: WHITE SPACE (most powerful, most subtle)
|     |
|     +---> Set all text to one font, one size, regular weight
|     +---> Use only position and spacing to differentiate
|     +---> Group related items with less space between them
|     +---> Place important items at top-left (web)
|     +---> Use cap height as spacing unit between related items
|     +---> Is hierarchy clear enough? --> Yes: STOP. No: continue.
|
+---> Step 2: TYPE WEIGHT
|     |
|     +---> Bold primary elements, regular for secondary
|     +---> If body text is bolded, increase line-height to lighten texture
|     +---> Is hierarchy clear enough? --> Yes: STOP. No: continue.
|
+---> Step 3: TYPE SIZE
|     |
|     +---> Use a proportional scale (e.g., 3:4 ratio: 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 21, 28, 37, 50, 67)
|     +---> Skip steps for meaningful contrast (9pt to 16pt, not 9pt to 12pt)
|     +---> Minimum ~25% size difference between hierarchy levels
|     +---> Is hierarchy clear enough? --> Yes: STOP. No: continue.
|
+---> Step 4: COLOR
|     |
|     +---> Add color only where additional differentiation is needed
|     +---> Warm colors for primary (pop forward), cool for secondary (recede)
|     +---> Is hierarchy clear enough? --> Yes: STOP. No: continue.
|
+---> Step 5: VISUAL ORNAMENTATION (last resort)
|     |
|     +---> Rules, blocks of color, icons -- sparingly
|     +---> Every rule line must have a clear purpose
|     +---> Removing it should lose meaningful differentiation
|
+---> Step 6: TYPEFACE CONTRAST (for conceptual differences)
      |
      +---> Use a different typeface to signal different NATURE of information
      +---> Example: Serif for content, sans-serif for metadata
      +---> This signals the information is conceptually different, not just ranked differently

## 4. Common Mistakes Master Table

**Last reviewed: 2026-07**

| Mistake | Why It Happens | Correct Approach | Source |
|---------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| Treating design as a final polish step | Engineering-first culture | Integrate design thinking from project inception | Ch 1 |
| Adding visual decoration to compensate for weak design | Mistaking decoration for design | Remove unnecessary decoration; ensure every element serves the purpose | Ch 1 |
| Copying successful designs wholesale | Assumes what works for one product works for another | Derive design from your own purpose, audience, and medium | Ch 1 |
| Neglecting information design while polishing visual design | Visual design is more obvious and "fun" | Treat information organization as first-class design concern (28%+ of credibility) | Ch 1 |
| Over-polishing to signal quality | Assumes more polish always equals more trust | Calibrate polish to context; over-polish triggers skepticism | Ch 1 |
| Following do's and don'ts lists without understanding why | Lists are easy to follow but don't build understanding | Learn underlying layers (purpose, medium, aesthetics) | Ch 1 |
| Only learning "one trick" (drawing ponies) | One technique seems impressive in limited contexts | Build broad understanding of design layers | Ch 1 |
| Treating design as purely visual/decorative | Developers associate "design" with surface styling | Design is multi-layered: product goals, user needs, culture, technology, and visuals | Ch 2 |
| Skipping personas and use cases | Feels like bureaucratic overhead | Even 5-minute personas dramatically focus design decisions | Ch 2 |
| Over-investing in visual design for utility product | Assumes all products need polished visual design | Assess competitive landscape; "good enough" works when solving real pain point | Ch 2 |
| Under-investing for personal/identity product | Assumes functionality alone wins | Products tied to personal identity demand design investment | Ch 2 |
| Getting caught up in visual details during wireframing | Tools make it easy to add styling | Keep wireframes deliberately rough; goal is layout and structure | Ch 2 |
| Conflating visual design with user experience | Sees them as synonymous | Visual design is one component of UX (also includes usability, content, IA) | Ch 2 |
| Using Garamond for web body text | Knows it's a respected classic | Use Georgia or another screen-optimized serif for body text | Ch 3 |
| Dismissing Comic Sans without understanding why | Cultural hatred without typographic understanding | Understand it fails in high-res due to poor visual weight, bad letterfit | Ch 3 |
| Choosing fonts based purely on aesthetic preview | Font picker shows at display sizes | Always test at actual rendering size in actual target medium | Ch 3 |
| Treating all serif fonts as equivalent | Lack of structural awareness | Learn classifications; transitional (Georgia) vs humanist (Garamond) have different properties | Ch 3 |

| Ignoring font fallback stacks | Assuming embedded fonts always load | Always define CSS fallbacks sharing structural properties | Ch 3 |
| Using print fonts in digital interfaces | Seeing typeface used beautifully in print | Print and screen are fundamentally different rendering media | Ch 3 |
| Copying a style's surface without understanding why it exists | Faster, and "look" seems to matter | Study technological and cultural forces that produced the style | Ch 4 |
| Building entire sites in Flash | Flash enabled richer visuals | Use semantic HTML/CSS; CSS3 now supports most visual effects | Ch 4 |
| Treating SEO as separate from design | Designers focus on aesthetics | SEO is designer's responsibility -- findability is design | Ch 4 |
| Using generic title tags ("Home Page") | Default CMS behavior | Write unique, keyphrase-rich titles for every page | Ch 4 |
| Using non-descriptive URLs | Default CMS/framework behavior | Configure human-readable, keyword-containing URL slugs | Ch 4 |
| Naming images `IMG_001.jpg` with empty alt text | Direct from camera | Rename descriptively; write meaningful alt text | Ch 4 |
| Keyword stuffing and hidden text | Desire for quick SEO gains | Google detects and penalizes; focus on legitimate content | Ch 4 |
| Targeting only high-volume keyphrases | More searches = better assumption | Start with achievable low-volume phrases; build authority first | Ch 4 |
| Ignoring analytics data for keyword strategy | Assumed they know their best keywords | Check which keywords already drive traffic; build on successes | Ch 4 |
| Using `<em>` and `<strong>` purely for visual styling | Confusion between semantic and visual emphasis | Use semantic tags intentionally for genuinely important words | Ch 4 |
| Treating golden ratio as guaranteed formula for beauty | Pop-culture mythology | One tool among several; no ratio guarantees beauty | Ch 5 |
| Claiming Parthenon/Mona Lisa/nautilus "prove" golden ratio | Confirmation bias | Actually measure; most examples don't precisely match | Ch 5 |
| Using only golden ratio when simpler ratios work | Not knowing about 2:3 or 3:4 | Choose simplest ratio that works; 2:3 and 3:4 easier to calculate | Ch 5 |
| Forcing proportions rigidly at expense of design | Mathematical perfection = visual perfection belief | Use proportions as flexible guidelines; override when needed | Ch 5 |
| Ignoring proportions entirely, using arbitrary sizes | Not knowing proportional systems exist | Pick one ratio and derive key dimensions from it | Ch 5 |
| Making all elements same size for "consistency" | Confusing consistency with uniformity | Varied sizes with proportional relationships create more interest | Ch 5 |
| Applying golden ratio to internal elements but not canvas | Starting with details before framework | Start with canvas proportions, then derive internal dimensions | Ch 5 |
| Making everything equally prominent | Treating all content as equally important | Establish clear hierarchy with one dominant element | Ch 6 |
| Ignoring reading direction for web layouts | Placing content based on visual balance alone | Respect F-pattern: most important content top-left | Ch 6 |

| Mixing unrelated shapes and styles | Designing each element independently | Establish shape language and apply consistently | Ch 6 |
| Relying solely on grid without directional forces | Assuming grid alone creates good composition | Grid determines position; principles determine eye movement | Ch 6 |
| No hover/interactive state changes for web elements | Styling elements identically in all states | Use foreground/background shift on hover | Ch 6 |
| Using texture uniformly or not at all | Same treatment for all surfaces | Vary texture intentionally to create depth | Ch 6 |
| Changing too many visual factors at once | Unsure which factor will "work" | Isolate factors; change one at a time starting with white space | Ch 7 |
| Using only the most obvious factors (size, color, decoration) | Feel most impactful because most visible | Subtlest factors (white space, proportion) often have most impact | Ch 7 |
| Adding rule lines to tables for "organization" | Assumption that lines guide the eye | Alignment guides the eye; remove lines, use white space | Ch 7 |
| Choosing type sizes with trivial differences (13px vs 14px) | Web gives unlimited size options | Use proportional scale and skip steps; 9pt to 16pt is meaningful | Ch 7 |
| Making all metadata equally prominent | Treating metadata as single "block" | Each metadata item has different relationship to content; style accordingly | Ch 7 |
| Overusing ornamentation when design "doesn't look clean" | Mistaking lack of decoration for lack of design | Strip back to one font, one size, white space only; build up | Ch 7 |
| Ignoring leading when using bold body text | Not realizing bold creates heavier texture | Increase line-height when body text is bolded | Ch 7 |
| Using HSB/HSL hue rotation for data visualization | HSB/HSL pickers make it easy to select "different" colors | Use Lab-based selection or Colorbrewer for perceptual uniformity | Ch 8 |
| Assuming HSL Lightness is perceptually accurate | Name "Lightness" implies accuracy | Use Lab L value for true perceptual lightness | Ch 8 |
| Using only color to communicate meaning | Seems culturally obvious and clean | Always add redundant cues: shapes, icons, text labels | Ch 8 |
| Expecting printed colors to match screen colors | Colors look same on designer's screen | Understand RGB/CMYK gamut differences; use ICC profiles | Ch 8 |
| Saving web images with Adobe RGB profiles | Designer works in Adobe RGB for wider gamut | Save in sRGB; strip ICC profiles for CSS-matching images | Ch 8 |
| Treating hex codes as opaque magic strings | Hex notation seems arbitrary | Learn #RRGGBB maps to three 0-255 channels; practice 0,3,6,9,C,F | Ch 8 |
| Ignoring colorblindness because "it's rare" | Assumes own vision is universal | Red-green affects up to 10% of males; always test | Ch 8 |
| Using pure black (#000) for text and shadows throughout | Simplest option | Use hue-shifted dark colors; pure black nearly doesn't exist in nature | Ch 9 |
| Using red prominently in performance-based interfaces | Red feels bold and attention-grabbing | Red overloads prefrontal cortex; use blue/green for analytical contexts | Ch 9 |
| Choosing colors individually by preference with no color wheel relationship | Lacks color theory training | Start with a formal color scheme and adjust from there | Ch 9 |
| Using blue text for non-link content | Blue seems like nice readable color | Blue is universal web convention for links; users will try to click | Ch 9 |
| Bright saturated background on content-rich site | Bright colors make immediate impact | Causes fatigue on text-heavy pages; reserve for splash pages | Ch 9 |
| Using all colors in palette equally | Every color "deserves" equal representation | Pick one or two dominant; use others sparingly as accents | Ch 9 |
| Ignoring cultural color associations for international audience | Assumes own cultural associations are universal | Research target culture's color associations before finalizing | Ch 9 |
| Using completely monochromatic scheme with no accent | Monochromatic feels "safe" | Add at least one accent color from outside the scheme for CTAs | Ch 9 |
| Assuming complementary colors are always jarring | Avoids complementary for gentle sites | Complementary can be gentle when muted, desaturated, or tinted | Ch 9 |
| Picking fonts by decorative classification alone | Popular systems describe traits not structure | Focus on letter structure (humanist, geometric, realist) for pairing | Appendix |
| Pairing two fonts that are "sort of similar" | Intuitively seeks similarity | Commit to harmony (matching structures) or contrast (dramatically different) | Appendix |
| Using Faux Bold in design tools | Button is right there and seems to work | Always load and use authentic bold weight | Appendix |
| Using software-generated italic | One-click italic in tools | Load authentic italic version | Appendix |
| Justifying web body text | Looks "neater" with aligned edges | Use ragged right; CSS lacks hyphenation support | Appendix |
| Using two spaces after periods | Learned in typing class | One space; extra space pokes holes in text block | Appendix |
| Using straight quotes from keyboard | Keyboard produces straight by default | Use smart quotes: `&ldquo;` `&rdquo;` `&lsquo;` `&rsquo;` | Appendix |
| Using double hyphens for dashes | Typewriter convention | Use spaced en dash `&ndash;` or em dash `&mdash;` | Appendix |
| Both indenting AND spacing paragraphs | "More is better" instinct | Choose ONE: indent or spacing, never both | Appendix |
| Indenting the first paragraph of a section | Treating all paragraphs the same | Don't indent the opening paragraph; it's the first | Appendix |
| Stretching/compressing type to fit a space | Trying to make text fit | Use a specifically designed condensed/extended variant | Appendix |
| Using Times New Roman as go-to serif | Universally available | Use Georgia instead -- designed for screen readability | Appendix |
| Using monospaced fonts for body text | Available on every system | Monospaced creates uneven texture; reserve for code only | Appendix |

## 5. Implementation Quick-Start

A condensed checklist for a developer building a new UI from scratch.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Before Any Visual Work)

- [ ] **Define purpose** -- What should users feel, do, and trust? *(Ch 1)*
- [ ] **Create user personas** -- Name, occupation, quote, key needs (even 5-minute versions) *(Ch 2)*
- [ ] **Define use cases** -- Most common user interactions *(Ch 2)*
- [ ] **Assess competitive context** -- Does this product category reward visual design? *(Ch 2)*
- [ ] **Identify medium constraints** -- Screen resolution, device targets, browser support *(Ch 1, Ch 3)*
- [ ] **Determine target keyphrases** for SEO *(Ch 4)*

### Phase 2: Structure (Wireframes & Layout)

- [ ] **Create wireframes** -- Layout and information architecture, no visual styling *(Ch 2)*
- [ ] **Choose a proportional system** -- 2:3 (easy math) or 3:4 (flexible grid) *(Ch 5)*
- [ ] **Set canvas/container proportions** intentionally using chosen ratio *(Ch 5)*
- [ ] **Determine margins** using proportional methods (Tschichold diagonal-line or ratio-based) *(Ch 5)*
- [ ] **Establish a grid** -- Derive column divisions from proportional system *(Ch 5, Ch 7)*
- [ ] **Build semantic HTML** -- Proper heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2-H6), `<em>`, `<strong>` *(Ch 4)*
- [ ] **Set descriptive URLs**, unique `<title>` tags, `<meta description>` for every page *(Ch 4)*

### Phase 3: Typography

- [ ] **Choose primary body font** -- Sans-serif for web, serif for print *(Appendix)*
- [ ] **Verify medium compatibility** -- Squint test for texture, check x-height for screen *(Ch 3)*
- [ ] **If pairing a second font**: Match letter structures (the `n` test) or use extreme contrast *(Appendix)*
- [ ] **Ensure one serif + one sans-serif** (max two families) *(Appendix)*
- [ ] **Set type scale** using proportional ratio (e.g., 3:4: 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 21, 28, 37, 50, 67) *(Ch 7)*
- [ ] **Set line-height** to 1.2-1.4em for body copy *(Appendix)*
- [ ] **Set alignment** to ragged right for web *(Appendix)*
- [ ] **Load authentic font weights** -- No fake bold, fake italic, fake small caps *(Appendix)*

### Phase 4: Visual Hierarchy

- [ ] **Start with white space only** -- Position and spacing to differentiate (one font, one size) *(Ch 7)*
- [ ] **Layer in weight** (bold for primary) *(Ch 7)*
- [ ] **Layer in size** (skip type scale steps for meaningful contrast) *(Ch 7)*
- [ ] **Layer in color** (warm for primary, cool for secondary) *(Ch 7, Ch 9)*
- [ ] **Add ornamentation last** -- Only if simpler factors are insufficient *(Ch 7)*
- [ ] **Remove unnecessary borders/rules** from tables (Tufte 1+1=3) *(Ch 7)*

### Phase 5: Color

- [ ] **Choose background** appropriate to content density *(Ch 9)*
- [ ] **Select base hue** matching desired mood and context *(Ch 9)*
- [ ] **Build scheme** from color wheel (monochromatic/analogous/complementary/etc.) *(Ch 9)*
- [ ] **Assign functional colors** -- Red = error, green = success, yellow = highlight, blue = links *(Ch 9)*
- [ ] **Use warm/cool** for depth (warm pops, cool recedes) *(Ch 9)*
- [ ] **Hue-shift shadows/highlights** instead of pure black/white *(Ch 9)*
- [ ] **Add redundant cues** to all color-coded information (shapes, text, icons) *(Ch 8)*
- [ ] **Test for colorblindness** using simulation tools *(Ch 8)*
- [ ] **Save web images in sRGB** -- Strip ICC profiles for CSS-matching images *(Ch 8)*

### Phase 6: Composition & Polish

- [ ] **Establish one dominant element** as visual anchor (size, color, value, white space) *(Ch 6)*
- [ ] **Create foreground/background depth** (shadows, color intensity, overlapping) *(Ch 6)*
- [ ] **Apply similarity** -- Consistent shape language, recurring visual motifs *(Ch 6)*
- [ ] **Build directional flow** -- Guide eye with alignment, progressive sizing, shape groupings *(Ch 6)*
- [ ] **Add rhythm** -- Repeating visual patterns at consistent intervals *(Ch 6)*
- [ ] **Add hover/interactive states** that shift foreground/background *(Ch 6)*
- [ ] **Use proper typographic characters** -- Smart quotes, proper dashes, prime marks *(Appendix)*
- [ ] **Descriptive image filenames and alt text** *(Ch 4)*

### Phase 7: Final Validation

- [ ] **Squint test** -- Dominant element still visible? Hierarchy clear? Text texture even? *(Ch 3, Ch 6, Ch 7)*
- [ ] **Eye recycling test** -- Does the eye circulate through the composition or exit? *(Ch 6)*
- [ ] **F-pattern check** -- Most important content top-left? *(Ch 6)*
- [ ] **Credibility check** -- Would a stranger say "professional" and "well organized"? *(Ch 1)*
- [ ] **Appropriateness check** -- Polish level matches context? *(Ch 1)*
- [ ] **Convention check** -- Functional colors match expectations (red=error, blue=link)? *(Ch 9)*
- [ ] **Crawler test** -- Can search engines access and index all important content? *(Ch 4)*
- [ ] **Strip test** -- Remove each piece of ornamentation; does hierarchy survive? *(Ch 7)*
- [ ] **Cultural check** -- Any unintended color associations for target audience? *(Ch 9)*
