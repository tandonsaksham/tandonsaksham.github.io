# Design systems governance — scaling, ownership, and delivery

The maintenance and delivery layer: how a design system stays coherent as it scales across teams, products, and time. Load when the question is about governance, contribution models, versioning, design-to-code pipelines, or organizational scaling.

## KEY DEFINITIONS

> **Design system team**: the people responsible for the system's health, roadmap, and quality — whether a dedicated team (centralized), embedded champions (federated), or a single owner (small-org).

> **Consumer**: a product team or individual developer who uses the design system to build product UI.

> **Contribution**: a new component, token, or pattern proposed by a consumer team that becomes part of the shared system.

> **Versioning (semver)**: semantic versioning — MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH — applied to the design system as a library. Breaking changes (token renames, removed components, changed API) increment MAJOR.

> **Deprecation**: marking an element as scheduled for removal, with a timeline and migration path for consumers.

> **Design-to-code pipeline**: the tooling that transforms design tokens from a source-of-truth format (W3C DTCG JSON) into platform-specific outputs (CSS custom properties, Swift color assets, Kotlin resources, etc.).

> **Style Dictionary**: the current canonical open-source tool for multi-platform token transformation. Consumes DTCG-format JSON; emits CSS, JS, Swift, Kotlin, and other formats. Maintained by Amazon.

## OWNERSHIP MODELS

Three models, each suited to a different organizational scale. The right model is determined by the number of consuming teams, the maturity of the system, and the available resourcing.

### Centralized (design-system team as sole contributor)

The design-system team owns, maintains, and ships all components and tokens. Consumer teams request changes; the DS team implements them.

**When it fits:** Small orgs with 1-3 product teams; early-stage systems that need coherence before scale.

**Strengths:** Consistent quality and coherence; single point of accountability; fast decisions.

**Weaknesses:** Bottleneck when consumer teams outgrow the DS team's capacity; consumer teams feel blocked; "throwing requests over the wall" dynamic.

**Mall's ROI threshold:** Centralized models show positive ROI at 2+ product teams sharing the system; the breakeven point on investment is typically 6-12 months of adoption at moderate team count.

### Federated (distributed champions + center)

Each domain or product team has embedded design-system champions (1-2 per team) who contribute to the system and adapt it for their domain. A small center (or a "center of excellence") maintains standards, reviews contributions, and manages the token core.

**When it fits:** Mid-size orgs with 3-10 product teams; mature systems where the core is stable and domains need controlled extension.

**Strengths:** Scales contribution bandwidth; champions reduce the bottleneck; domain teams have voice.

**Weaknesses:** Quality and consistency require strong review process; champions need training and time allocation; center must be staffed to remain credible.

### Hybrid (open contribution, DS team as stewards)

Any team can contribute via a defined RFC/PR process. The DS team reviews, refines, and merges contributions. Champions may or may not exist formally.

**When it fits:** Large orgs with 10+ teams; systems that need to absorb a high rate of new patterns.

**Strengths:** Maximum contribution bandwidth; community ownership builds adoption.

**Weaknesses:** Review queue becomes a bottleneck if DS team is understaffed; quality variance increases; needs strong automated tooling (linting, visual regression, accessibility tests) to catch regressions at volume.

## CONTRIBUTION MODELS

A contribution model defines how a consumer team proposes, develops, and lands new design-system elements.

### The standard RFC process

1. **Identify**: consumer team identifies a pattern that doesn't exist in the system and would be reusable across teams.
2. **Propose**: submit an RFC (Request for Comment) — a short doc describing the pattern, its use cases, the alternative patterns considered, and why this should be canonical rather than local.
3. **Review**: DS team (or champions) review the RFC for fit with the existing system, token usage, accessibility, and generalizability. Comment period: typically 1-2 weeks.
4. **Develop**: if approved, the consumer team (or DS team) develops the component to system standards — all states, token usage, ARIA, tests.
5. **Design review**: a synchronous or async review against the design review criteria (see `design-systems-foundations.md`).
6. **Ship**: merged into the system, published in the version, announced in the changelog.

### The three-tier contribution scope

Not all contributions are equal in scope or review cost:

| Tier | What it is | Review cost | Who decides |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Component token** | A new component-scoped token | Low | Per-team, with alias-tier review |
| **Alias token** | A new semantic mapping | Medium | DS team review required |
| **New component** | A new atom, molecule, or organism | High | Full RFC process |
| **Global token** | Change to palette.mjs output | Very high | Re-run palette.mjs + full alias/component audit |

### Fork-before-merge pattern

When a consumer team needs a component urgently and the RFC process will take too long: fork the component locally with a clear `TODO: migrate to design-system when RFC lands` comment. This surfaces the debt explicitly and provides a migration path rather than a permanent divergence.

---

## VERSIONING AND DEPRECATION

### Semver applied to design systems

Design systems are libraries: they version like software.

| Change type | Version bump | Examples |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Breaking change | MAJOR (x.0.0) | Token renamed; component API changed; component removed; alias tier restructured |
| New component/token; non-breaking addition | MINOR (0.x.0) | New component; new alias token; new theme variant |
| Bug fix; documentation update; non-breaking style fix | PATCH (0.0.x) | Wrong color value fixed; typo in documentation; missing state added without API change |

**Key rule:** Token renames are breaking changes. `color-text-primary` → `color-fg-primary` is a MAJOR bump because every consumer file that references the old token breaks. Always provide a migration guide.

### Changelog requirements

Every version ships with a changelog entry:
- What changed (component, token, or pattern name)
- Why it changed (design decision, accessibility fix, bug)
- Migration path for breaking changes (old value → new value; before code → after code)
- Deprecation notices with removal timeline

### Deprecation process

1. **Mark deprecated**: flag the element in the source, in Storybook, and in the changelog. Include the removal timeline (recommend: 2-3 MAJOR versions of notice, or 6 months minimum).
2. **Provide migration path**: document what replaces the deprecated element and exactly how to migrate.
3. **Lint enforcement**: add a linting rule that warns on use of the deprecated element.
4. **Remove**: after the notice period, remove in a MAJOR release. Remove the lint warning at the same time.

**Never silently remove** a component or token. Silent removal is the fastest way to lose consumer trust and adoption.

## DESIGN-TO-CODE PIPELINE

The pipeline that transforms source-of-truth tokens into platform-consumable code.

### Current tooling landscape (name examples to verify; do not pin versions)

| Tool | Role | When to reach for it |
|------|------|---------------------|
| **Style Dictionary** (Amazon) | Token transformation: DTCG JSON → CSS, Swift, Kotlin, etc. Current canonical multi-platform transformer | Primary recommendation for teams serving multiple platforms |
| **Cobalt** | Token transformation with DTCG-first design; tighter W3C spec adherence | Alternative when DTCG compliance is a hard requirement |
| **Theo** (Salesforce) | Token transformation; older; pre-DTCG; Salesforce's internal predecessor | Legacy systems or Salesforce ecosystem; not for new projects |
| **Storybook** | Component documentation, visual testing, and interactive sandbox | Standard component story tool; pairs with any token system |
| **Chromatic** | Visual regression testing on top of Storybook; CI/CD integration | When visual regression is a priority at scale |
| **Zeroheight / Supernova** | Design-to-code documentation hubs; sync from Figma | When documentation is the bottleneck, not the token pipeline |

### Standard pipeline (Style Dictionary)

```
DESIGN.md + palette.mjs output
         │
         ▼
  tokens/global.json      ← global tier (palette.mjs output)
  tokens/alias.json       ← alias tier (authored)
  tokens/components/*.json ← component tokens (authored)
         │
         ▼
  Style Dictionary config.json
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │         │
    ▼         ▼
  CSS custom  Swift
  properties  ColorAsset
  (web)       (iOS)
    │
    ▼
  Storybook stories
  (component documentation)
```

### What earns the integration cost

The design-to-code pipeline has real setup and maintenance cost. It earns that cost when:
- Multiple platforms consume the same tokens (web + iOS + Android).
- Multiple brands share the token structure (multi-brand theming is the payoff).
- The team has 3+ engineers consuming the tokens — manual sync at that scale breaks.
- Tokens change frequently (active design work) — automated transformation eliminates manual sync error.

It does NOT earn the cost when:
- A single web app consumes the tokens and CSS custom properties are sufficient.
- The team is ≤ 3 people building a single product.
- Token changes are rare (system is stable). In this case: CSS custom properties from palette.mjs, maintained manually, is the right answer.

### CSS output format (web standard)

For web-only pipelines, CSS custom properties are the standard output:

```css
:root {
  /* Global tokens (from palette.mjs) */
  --color-blue-500: #2563eb;
  --space-4: 1rem;

  /* Alias tokens */
  --color-text-primary: var(--color-blue-900);
  --color-interactive-default: var(--color-blue-500);
  --space-content-gap: var(--space-4);

  /* Component tokens (in component stylesheets) */
  --button-background: var(--color-interactive-default);
  --button-padding-x: var(--space-content-gap);
}
```

Dark mode via a `[data-theme="dark"]` selector or `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` that overrides alias tokens only — global tokens remain constant.

## SCALING — WHEN AND WHY

**Source:** Mall *Design That Scales* (2023).

Design systems have a breakeven point. Below the threshold, a design system is overhead. Above it, a design system pays compound dividends.

### The ROI calculation

Mall's research identifies the key variables:
- **Reuse multiplier**: each hour of design-system work saves N hours of per-product design/dev work. N > 1 is the threshold.
- **Consumer team count**: more teams → higher reuse multiplier → faster payoff.
- **Change frequency**: a stable design system (mature product, slow change) has lower ongoing cost; a dynamic system (active design work) has higher ongoing cost but also higher reuse value.

Rule of thumb: a design system shows positive ROI at **3+ product teams** sharing the same component architecture. Below that, a well-documented DESIGN.md + CSS custom properties + shared component file is usually sufficient.

### Governance scales with the system

As the system grows, governance requirements scale:

| System maturity | Governance requirement |
|----------------|----------------------|
| 1 product, 1-2 engineers | DESIGN.md + CSS custom properties + weekly sync |
| 2-4 products, dedicated DS champion | Storybook + centralized contribution model + semver |
| 5-10 products, DS team | Full RFC process + automated visual regression + federated contributors |
| 10+ products, multi-brand | Full pipeline + Style Dictionary + Chromatic + formal governance |

Governance complexity that outpaces the system's actual scale is a tax, not a benefit.

## RED FLAGS

**Last reviewed: 2026-07**

| Signal | What it indicates |
|--------|------------------|
| Components that bypass the token tier (hard-coded hex) | Token discipline hasn't been enforced; theming will break |
| "We have a design system" but no changelog | Changes happen informally; breaking changes land as surprises |
| Stale Storybook that doesn't match production | The pipeline is broken or unenforced; documentation is fiction |
| Consumer teams forking components and not merging back | The contribution process is too slow or too opaque |
| Token names that are just renamed global values | The alias tier is cosmetic, not semantic; theming is impossible |
| No owner named for the system | System will drift; no one will notice or fix regressions |
| Design system not versioned | Consumer teams can't pin to a stable version; surprise breakage |
| Breaking changes shipped as patches | Consumers learn not to trust the version; they either pin old versions or check every update manually |

---

## GOVERNANCE AUDIT CRITERIA

When auditing an existing design system's governance:

| Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|-----------|------|------|
| Named owner | A person or team is accountable for the system | No clear owner; "everyone" owns it |
| Contribution model documented | RFC process or equivalent exists and is accessible | No process; changes happen ad-hoc |
| Changelog present and current | Every version has a changelog entry | No changelog; changelog is months out of date |
| Deprecation process active | Deprecated items are marked, timeline is stated, migration is documented | Silent removal; deprecated items not marked |
| Semver applied correctly | MAJOR bumps for breaking changes; communicated clearly | Breaking changes in MINOR or PATCH; consumers surprised |
| Pipeline automated | Token transformation runs in CI/CD | Manual sync; tokens in CSS differ from tokens in Figma |
| Visual regression in place | Chromatic or equivalent catches unintentional visual changes | No visual regression; regressions discovered in production |
| Consumer feedback loop | Mechanism exists for consumers to report issues and request contributions | No feedback channel; consumers fork silently |
